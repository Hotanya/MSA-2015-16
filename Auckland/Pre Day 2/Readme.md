#Pre day 2 requirements

Please read through all of this and make sure you have satisfied the requirements 

## 1. Update Microsoft SQL Server

Go to Tools > Extensions and Updates. Click on "Updates" (down the left hand side) and update the one to do with Microsoft SQL Server. Here's what it looks like, yours may be different:

## 2. Create an Empty ASP.NET Web Application with Web API

We found that quite a few people were unable to do this on day 1. Make sure you are able to create an Empty ASP.NET Web Application with Web API ticked, like this:

![2-2](/Others/_images/Pre day 2/2-2.PNG)

After selecting the above, this should appear:

![2-3](/Others/_images/Pre day 2/2-3.PNG)

If you can do this, then you are all ready to go for day 2. However, if the second image does not show up for you, open up control panel and go to Programs and Features. Click on "Microsoft Visual Studio xxxx" (whatever version yours is, it should ideally be 2015) and click on "Change". Once that is loaded, click on "Modify". Search for "Microsoft Web Developer Tools", and *make sure that box is ticked*!

Then, click on Update. After the update is done, restart your computer and try to create a new empty project with Web API ticked, like the images above. 

If the second image still does not show up for you even after doing that (you're probably on an earlier VS version), try the method suggested here https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff521558(v=vs.110).aspx
