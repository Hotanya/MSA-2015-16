# Auckland Training Events

Auckland training is divided into three days:

## 1. Day 1

Day 1 will focus on introducing the students to MSA Phase 2, talking about the assessments and assessment scenarios. We will then dive into writing a Web App in Visual Studio.

## 2. Day 2

You'll be making your very own web API on day 2, connected to a database that's hosted online with MySQL. We will then connect the front end you made on day 1 to your web API. Navigate to the Day 2 folder to have a look at what's covered. 

## 3. Day 3
